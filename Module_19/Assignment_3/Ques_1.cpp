/*
Q1. Which of the following(s) is/are true about bubble sort:
A) It is stable sort.
B) It has a worst case space complexity of O(n).
C) It involves swapping of adjacent elements.
D) After each iteration, the greatest element is placed at the end of the array.

Solution
both (A) and (C) are true
option (D) is not right because So, after each iteration, the greatest of the remaining unsorted 
elements is moved to its correct sorted position, but not necessarily to the very end of the array.
