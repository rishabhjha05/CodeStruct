Q2. What will the following array look like after one iteration of bubble sort [1,6,2,5,4,3].
(A) [1,3,2,4,5,6]
(B) [1,2,3,4,5,6]
(C) [1,2,5,4,3,6]
(D) [1,2,4,5,3,6]

after the first iteration of the bubble sort algorithm the largest element among all the element in the given array 
will get to the last position of the array wihtout disturbing the order of the element int the given array 
the swaping will happen in between the adjucent elements hence after the first iteration of the bubble sort algorithm 
the largest element ie 6 will shift to end of the array without disturbing relative order of the other elements of 
the array hence the array will look like this after first iteration of the bubble sort algorithm 
(C) [1,2,5,4,3,6]
ans the
